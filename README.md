# MLPractice
This repo stores all the ML related content, I will post the code and update the progress here.

## Material
* [Bayesian ML in CU](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E6720/BayesianModelsMachineLearning2016.pdf)
* [Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses.html)
* Andrew's deep learning course on Coursera is still very good (as it's still free).
* Paper on [Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952v3.pdf) (added 02/12/19)

## What's included here
* [Some basic bash commands](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/MLPractice/blob/master/shell/bash.md)
* [Basic knowledge on AI](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/MLPractice/blob/master/AI/artificial_intelligence.md)

## Updates
### 09/06/18
Initiated the repo, started from Bayesian ML theory and get hands dirty on deep learning code.

### 01/25/19
This repo has been updated into a repo that contains not only ML but also other stuff related to Hive or Bash. And I decide to make it public because I believe people can find something useful from this repo. Again, this repo is not well organized yet and I will keep updating it by adding more real code and tutorials.
