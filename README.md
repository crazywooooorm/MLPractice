# MLPractice
This repo stores all the ML related content, we will post the code and update the progress here.

## Recent Book List
[Bayesian ML in CU](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E6720/BayesianModelsMachineLearning2016.pdf) (my nightmare)

[Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses.html) offers some good tips on tuning parameter and model selection

Also, Andrew's deep learning course on Coursera is still very good (as it's still free).
