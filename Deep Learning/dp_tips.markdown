# Tips on Deep Learning
Tips Andrew mentioned in his courses
------------------------------------

## Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

* In logistic regression, typically people prefer log loss function rather than
squared loss function because squared loss function make the optimization
problem become non-convex and have multiple local optima.

* The loss function calculates the loss for one observation, and cost function
is usually the average of the loss of many observations.
